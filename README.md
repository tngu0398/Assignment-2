# ETO5513 Collaborative and Reproducible Practices - Assignment 2

## Project Description 
Alcohol Consumption data sets from OurWorldInData.org to provide a report on alcohol consumption around the world and their effects 

### Jane's Section 
Using the Total Alcohol Consumption per Capita data set to find trends and patterns in the global alcohol usage over time. Identified the changes of total alcohol consumption by geographical regions from 2000 to 2018. Further analysed the underlying relationship between religion and total alcohol consumption in regions. This analysis provided valuable insights into consistently low alcohol usage locations were countries where Islam is the predominant practice. 

### Gloria's Section
In an attempt to further understand how much alcohol abuse impacts people's health and life, we investigated the death caused by alcohol use disorders directly (excluding suicide cases) per country/region from 2010-2019. "Entity", "Year", "Code" and "Death_alcohol_use_disorders" were selected for analysis and NA values were excluded in calculation. The geographical distribution and trend over the years were examined, which provides us insights into how we could better offer support.
